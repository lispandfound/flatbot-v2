Hi, resurrected flatbot here! Here is how to use me:

To say that Daniel owes me $100, type /owes @Daniel $100.
The @ is important, it will pop up with people to select when you do this.

To get the current tally of debts, type /tally.

To settle debts (payable to you, and receivable to you) with Daniel, use /settle @Daniel.
Again the @ is important.
